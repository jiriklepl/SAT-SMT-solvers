\begin{quote}
    (10 points) Let $\varphi$ be a CNF and $C \in \varphi$ a clause in $\varphi$ and $l \in C$ a literal in $C$. We say that $C$ is
blocked by literal $l$ if for every other clause $D \in \varphi$ which contains $\neg l$ we have that $Res_l(C, D)$ is a
tautology (i.e. there is another literal $l_D \in D$ such that $\neg l_D \in C$). Show that $\varphi$ is equisatisfiable with
$\varphi \setminus \{C\}$, i.e. $\varphi$ is satisfiable if and only if $\varphi \setminus \{C\}$ is satisfiable.
\end{quote}

Let $\alpha$ be an assignment over the variables of $\varphi$. Then we have the following two options:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\neg l_D \in \alpha$ for at least one of the clauses $D$: then under the assumption $\neg l_D \in \alpha$ it holds that $\varphi$ and $\varphi \setminus \{C\}$ are equisatisfiable as $C$ is a tautology under the assumption and removing a tautology has no effect on satisfiability.
    \item $l_D \in \alpha$ for each of the clauses $D$: We know that $l$ is not present in any clause other than $C$ and all clauses that contain $\neg l$ are tautologies under the assumption $\{l_D | \text{for every } D\} \subseteq \alpha$. If $\alpha$ such that $\neg l \in \alpha$ satisfies $\varphi$, then $\alpha' = \alpha \triangle \{l, \neg l\}$ also satisfies $\varphi$. This learned fact can be formalized into a clause as follows:
    \begin{definition}[Learned fact]
        \label{learned_fact}
        $$\bigwedge \{l_D | \text{for every } D\} \to \{l\} \equiv \{\neg l_D | \text{for every } D\} \cup \{l\} \equiv A$$
    \end{definition}
    Then we can easily notice that $A \subseteq C$ and therefore the clause $C$ is a tautology under the assumption $\{l_D | \text{for every } D\} \cup \{l\} \subseteq \alpha$ implied by $A$ from the original assumption; and, similarly to the first option, this means that $\varphi$ and $\varphi \setminus \{C\}$ are equisatisfiable under the assumption $\{l_D | \text{for every } D\} \subseteq \alpha$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{observation}
    The fact $A$ in definition \ref{learned_fact} can be directly deduced from the setup; and $C$ is weaker than or equivalent to $A$. And therefore, $C$ is also a fact.
\end{observation}
