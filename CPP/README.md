## Tseitin Encoding and DIMACS Format

The implementation for this assignment, `formula2cnf`, built by `Makefile`, takes a formula in the SATLIB format and outputs in the DIMACS format.

It recognized the option `-e` (or `--equiv`) if the user requires using equivalence in the Tseitin encoding.

The output is as requested with comments giving detailed description of the structure:

- the first line contains the source file of the formula
- then follows the list of variables
- and then the list of all gates
- the last comment contains the root of the structure

## DPLL Algorithm &  Watched Literals

The implementation can take a file in SATLIB or DIMACS format. It can deduce the format from the extension of the file name or the format can be specified by either `-c|--dimacs` option or `-s|--satlib` option.

By default, it will use the version of the algorithm with watched literals, this can be changed to the version with adjacency lists by using the `-a|--adjacency` option.

And it also supports the `-e|--equiv` option from the `formula2cnf` program.

## Build

The following command builds the `formula2cnf` binary:

```sh
make formula2cnf
```

The following command builds the release version of the dpll `bin/main` binary:

```sh
make release
```

The following command will build the debug version with extra assertions in the code ensuring it works as intended:

```sh
make debug
```

## Run

The following command runs the dpll program

```sh
bin/main
```

## Comparison of watched literals and adjacency lists

The two version of the program were tested using [RND3SAT](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/Benchmarks/SAT/RND3SAT/descr.html) uf test sets with 20, 50, and 100 variables (see [links.txt](links.txt)) by the `test.sh` script. And then analyzed by the  `script.R` R script.

The conclusion is that the 'watched literals' version offers almost 50% mean speedup while preserving the number of decisions and the number of derivation performed while finding the model.

Here is the relative mean comparison generated by the R script (watched literals speedup compared to adjacency lists):

```
  variables     time decisions derivations
1        20 1.258361 1.0003466   1.0009109
2        50 1.560218 0.9664431   0.9666468
3       100 1.568032 0.9575588   0.9584289
```
